  %section.what
    %p
      <strong>Sharing information is difficult.</strong> We ask each other the
      same questions over and over again. Whenever answers are written down, we
      often don't know where to look. Worse, information goes out of date really
      fast.

  %section.how
    %h1
      Orientation makes this easier.
      %strong= link_to "See for yourself.", "http://try.orientation.io"

    .feature
      %h2#articles Articles
      %p
        Have a question? Create an article and ask someone to write down the
        answer. Know an answer? It works the same way, except you can write the
        article out and share it with more than one person.

    .feature
      %h2#subscription Subscription
      %p
        Do you depend on a piece of information that may evolve in the future? Simply
        subscribe to an article and you will be notified whenever it's edited in the
        future so your knowledge stays fresh.

    .feature
      %h2#endorsements Endorsement
      %p
        If someone else on your team can confirm the usefulness or validity of one
        of your Orientation articles, they can endorse it to increase its ranking in
        search results and make everyone on your team feel more confident.

    .feature
      %h2#search Search
      %p
        It's not so hard to make documentation. What's often harder is to find
        it when you need it. Worse, when you don't even know it exists. Orientation
        uses full-text search on article titles and contents.

    .feature
      %h2#guides Guides
      %p
        It's easier to find answers when you know what you're looking for.
        Guides are lists of links to articles. They can help onboard new
        employees, discuss best practices, or just make lists of lists.
